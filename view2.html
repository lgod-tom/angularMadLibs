		There once was a human named {{displayName}}, they really hated their job as a {{displayJob}}. So one day they decided to {{displayAction}} and quit. This wasn't the best idea because they needed to buy {{displayFood}} for their pet {{displayPet}} to eat. So {{displayName}} hatched a plan to rob the {{displaySportTeam}} while they were practicing in {{displayPlace}}. This backfired when {{displayNoun}} called {{displayName}} {{displayAdjective}}. {{displayName}} ended up in jail but at least they weren't a {{displayJob}} anymore.
